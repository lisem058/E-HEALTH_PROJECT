# Part I

First part works with the data from the Kaggle dataset (you can find in the datasets folder). 
We're doing the stuff considering the "serious game" development
You need to **rename** the .csv file (SeriousDataset.csv) to work with the part II.

# Part II

Second part analyzes data trying to understand under which category the data is falling. 
Also here we're downloading the articles meta-data that contains information about the application.
And creates the final non-normalized dataset with each application assigned the category.

# To run it

To run them we highly recommend to use **colab.research.google.com** but if you don't want to use it by some reasons. 
You could run them in **Jupyter Notebook**
